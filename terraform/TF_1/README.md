## Terraform Challenge 1: Basic Apply

### Description

For the first task, you will create a GCS bucket using the terraform config provided. It should be as simple as supplying a valid bucket name and typing `yes`

### Instructions
Change directories and prepare your terraform environment:

```bash
cd TF_1/
terraform init
terraform apply
```

It will ask you for an input variable for naming the bucket, and you might have to refine your response.
Keep attempting to run `terraform apply` until you get it to complete succesfully.
