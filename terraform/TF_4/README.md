## Terraform Challenge 4: Modules
### Description

Congratulations on making it this far in the alloted time. For this challenge, we'll take the code from TF_1 and modify it to use the nifty GCS bucket module that is included in the `modules/` directory

### Instructions

Change directories to TF_4 and get started. Work through the errors here, using any sources you would normally use. You will need to modify the code.

```bash
cd ../TF_4/
terraform init
```

Make additions to the `main.tf` file to use the [gcs module](../../modules/gcs/README.md). Include only the required variables.

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Good luck!
