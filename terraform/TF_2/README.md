# Terraform Challenge 2: Basic Error

### Description

Similar to the first challenge, but this time there will be an intentional error for you to fix. Read the error carefully.

### Instructions

Change directories to TF_2 and get started

```bash
cd ../TF_2/
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Work through the errors here, using any sources you would normally use. You will need to modify the code.

Good luck!
